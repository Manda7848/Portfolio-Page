Henlo There :)
THis is the project I am most proud of and obviously one I'm going to keep changing and keep improving
It has taught me many thing including but not limited to:
*The fact that commit messages are important for version location and rollback
*It's really fun when you code and it works. 
I'm gonna update this README when I have the time, bye for now
